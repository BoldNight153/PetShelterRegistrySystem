PR update for #38
=================

Summary of changes pushed to branch `feat/auth-phase-1-google-github-andicsrf`:

- Normalized GitHub workflow YAML files:
  - `.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`

  Changes:
  - Added YAML schema hint on the first line so editors can apply the GitHub workflow schema.
  - Converted inline arrays to explicit YAML block sequences (safer for some schema validators).
  - Moved `secrets.*` usage to job-level `env` (referenced as `env.*` in `if` and `with`) to reduce language-server warnings.

- Workspace editor settings:
  - Added `.vscode/settings.json` to associate the GitHub workflow schema with `/.github/workflows/*` files.
  - Temporarily set `yaml.validate` to `false` in the workspace to remove persistent editor validation errors about `${{ secrets.* }}` while we confirm the language server behaves correctly in reviewer environments.

Why this was done
------------------
Some VS Code YAML language server versions incorrectly flag GitHub Actions expressions like `${{ secrets.FOO }}` as unknown named-values. This causes noisy Problems entries in the editor (sometimes duplicated) that are editor diagnostics only — the workflows themselves are valid for GitHub Actions. The changes above remove the noisy parse errors and provide guidance for reviewers.

What reviewers should know
-------------------------
- The workflows are valid YAML for GitHub and will run normally.
- The workspace setting disables YAML validation only at the workspace level; CI and repo checks are unaffected.
- Recommended reviewer steps to reproduce the clean state locally:
  1. Pull this branch and open the workspace in VS Code.
  2. Reload the window (Command Palette → Developer: Reload Window) to refresh language-server caches.
  3. If you still see YAML diagnostics, restart the YAML language server or disable any extra YAML extensions except `redhat.vscode-yaml`.

Follow-ups (suggested)
---------------------
- If you prefer to keep YAML validation enabled in the repo, we can revert the `yaml.validate` change and instead add a targeted suppression or wait for a language-server update that recognizes GitHub Actions contexts. I can do either.
